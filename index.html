      <p>I was so happy to have won the first prize in our inter school debate! It was on environmental pollution, and
      we all worked very hard to debate against our own school's students. We were all very enthusiastic and it was very
      fun for all the students. We all learned a lot about environmental pollution!

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to 
        consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus 
        with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and 
        parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be 
        provided with a school canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices 
        and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
        eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. 
        Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

    1. Accuracy
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
    management systems ensure accurate time records and minimalize the inevitable and costly errors with annual data
    entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performence and payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Economics
    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs! It save money by putting an end
    to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
    of fact, a study done by the Ausion Group found that large organizations save upto $1,000 per employee after
    implementing automated attendance management systems.
    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency
    Monitoring and managing attendance wally can be a time-comsuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
    time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create
    payroll manually, Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
    keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and
    effort saved, combined with data accuracy, helps in optimizing the use of resources which leads to increased
    productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management,
    Flexibility, Integration / Configuration, Realtime tracking Security, and compliance.
